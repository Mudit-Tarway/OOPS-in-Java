# OOPS-in-Java

**🚀 OOPS in Java – Lab Solutions**

This repository contains my weekly Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) in Java lab solutions from college.
Each week, new problems are added along with their solutions, showcasing concepts of OOPS in Java such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation, and more.
