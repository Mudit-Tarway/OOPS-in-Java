1. Create a shape class with two method calculate_area() and calculate_perimeter(). Create three subclasses Rectangle, Square and Circle 
    that will be override the calculate_area() and calculate_perimeter() method. Create a Test class with a main() method that creates the 
    objects of all these classes and invoke respective methods.

2. Create a class Student with public data member name and private data members id and marks. Write public set and get methods for the private 
   data members. Use a constructor to set id to 211001000000 and marks to 0. Take the last 4 digits of the id from user and construct the full id. 
   Take the name and marks as input. Display name, full id and marks of 2 students.

3. Suppose you are asked to model a toy-train ride at an amusement park. Passengers are expected to pay Rs. 50 for a ticket. 
   Children do not need a ticket. The ticket counter keeps track of the number of passengers that have gone by, and of the total
   amount of money collected.
   a)	Model this ticket-counter with a class called ticket-counter. Use a type unsigned int to hold the total number of passengers, 
        and a type double to hold the total amount of money collected.
   b)	Use a constructor to initialize both of these to 0.
   c)	Add the following member functions:
            i.	payingPassenger() that increments the passenger total by 1 and adds Rs. 50 to the cash total.
            ii.	childPassenger() that increments the passenger total, but does not add anything to the cash total.
            iii.	A member function called display() that display the two totals.
   d)	Include a program to test this class. The program should allow a ticket-collector to press one key to count a paying passenger, another key to count a child passenger. By the pushing a third key the collector can print the total number of passengers, total amount of cash collected and then exit.
